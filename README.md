Garnet provides a single source of truth for your configurations, and lets you fetch them into your apps automatically. 

- **Encrypted Storage** · centrally store and manage your all your configuration parameters and secrets.
- **Auto-Injection** · fetch and inject environment variables into your apps at build or run time.
- **Dashboard** · a Web UI to create, update, view and delete projects and configurations.
- **CLI** · a command-line tool to fetch configurations from Garnet into your applications.
- **Self-hosting** · easily deploy Garnet within your own environment, on the platform of your choice.
- **Integrations** · integrate with popular deployment platforms. Check out currently supported [integrations](https://docs.usegarnet.com/integration-guides/integrations), or feel free to contribute.  
- **Audit Logs** · coming soon 
- **Team Collaboration** · coming soon 
- **Role-Based Access Control** · coming soon
